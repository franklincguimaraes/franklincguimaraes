## 🔏 About me

Hi, I'm Franklin, and for the past 6 years, I have worked as a software developer. Throughout this period, I have gained extensive experience in developing high-availability applications, utilizing microservices architecture, and implementing DevOps methodologies.

Furthermore, I have collaborated on projects involving microservices architecture, which involves breaking down complex systems into smaller, independent services that can be deployed and scaled individually. This approach enhances development agility, flexibility, scalability, and resilience.

Lastly, I have actively participated in DevOps practices, working closely with cross-functional teams to automate infrastructure provisioning, deployment, and monitoring. This has resulted in faster and more efficient software delivery, along with the implementation of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

In summary, my experience with applications, microservices, and DevOps qualifies me to excel in fast-paced and dynamic environments where factors such as uptime, scalability, and agility are critical.
